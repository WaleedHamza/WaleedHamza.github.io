                "I have always been a lover of languages. My first memories were teaching
                  myself English while watching movies and then repeating the words to anyone who
                  would listen. This initial spark created a passion to master English which lead
                  me to become a translator for the US Army. Language, has the power to create
                  connections and influence people. My love of languages has evolved with my
                  career trajectory, so, it’s no surprise I found the same spark when introduced
                  to computer languages. In code, I have the same power to create connections and
                  influence people for good through my applications. I’m a solution focused
                  developer eager to tackle challenging issues and provide innovative solutions.
                  My strengths are persistence, personal integrity and a positive attitude. I’m a
                  resourceful, life-long learner, who enjoys collaborating across
                  multidisciplinary teams, but also can work independently. I’d love to grow as a
                  user centered developer, and improve the human condition by connecting users one
